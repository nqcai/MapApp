# MapApp

This web app was created using the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node). I built this out of inspiration from another demo. The app allows a users to add themselves with interests and details to a database of other users and to share their location as well. The user shows up on the map along with all other users. One can then search for other people based on criteria that are nearby. 

This is only an experimental app and is not published anywhere. To run locally after downloading...

1. Navigate to the app's main directory
2. Open up a terminal window and run: sudo mongod
3. In a separate terminal window, run: node server.js
4. Wait for the line "App listening on port 3000"
5. Open up Google Chrome and in the URL bar, navigate to: localhost:3000
6. Magic happens
